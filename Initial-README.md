This is my portfolio website built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. As a Digital Media student at Texas State University, I created this site to showcase my projects and development skills.

## Features

- Responsive design
- Project filtering system
- Progress tracking for ongoing projects
- Client testimonials
- Mobile navigation menu
- Custom animations
- Dark theme with subtle grid background

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- No frameworks or libraries (yet)

## Project Structure

The website includes several main sections:

- Hero section with typing animation
- Project showcase with filtering options
- About section
- Skills overview
- Contact information

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thesamc/portfolio.git
   ```

2. Open index.html in your browser

No build process or dependencies needed since this is a static website.

## Responsive Design

The website is responsive across different screen sizes:
- Mobile: 320px and up
- Tablet: 768px and up
- Desktop: 1024px and up

## Customization

Main colors and styles can be modified through CSS variables in the root selector:

```css
:root {
  --primary: #1a1a1a;
  --secondary: #252525;
  --text: #f8f9fa;
  --accent: #2472e8;
}
```

## Future Updates

I plan to add:
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Contact form functionality
- More interactive features
- Additional project showcases
